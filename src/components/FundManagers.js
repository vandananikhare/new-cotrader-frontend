<h3>Functional Programming with JavaScript</h3>
<p>When you start to explore the world of React programming, you’ll notice that the
topic of functional programming comes up a lot. Functional techniques are being
used more and more in JavaScript projects.
You may have already written functional JavaScript code without thinking about it. If
you’ve mapped or reduced an array, then you’re already on your way to becoming a
functional programmer. React, Flux, and Redux all fit within the functional JavaScript
paradigm. Understanding the basic concepts of functional programming will elevate
your knowledge of structuring React applications.</p>
