<h3>Keeping Up with the Changes</h3>
<p>As changes are made to React and related tools, sometimes there are breaking
changes. In fact, some of the future versions of these tools may break some of the
example code in this book. You can still follow along with the code samples. We’ll
provide exact version information in the package.json file, so that you can install these
packages at the correct version.
Beyond this book, you can stay on top of changes by following along with the official
React blog. When new versions of React are released, the core team will write a
detailed blog post and changelog about what is new.
There are also a variety of popular React conferences that you can attend for the latest
React information. If you can’t attend these in person, React conferences often release
the talks on YouTube following the events.</p>
